Extra credit assignment.

1. Using the unrolled loop dot product from lab1, implement matrix multiplication on CPU such that each value of the resulting matrix
   is computed as an individual dot-product. Time it, calculate bandwidth and flops and place into roofline model as in lab1 for a
   a pair of 1000x1000 matrices of floats initialized to a 'gray code' (chess board pattern) with values 0.2 and 0.6, [0][0] being 0.2.
   (5 points)

2. Using the tiling strategy shown in the class for GPUs, implement matrix multiplication decomposed into block matrices on CPU
    of size NxN and measure varying tile sizes to show the impact of using O(N^3) subproblems that fit into the L1 or L2 cache.
    I.e. there are at least 2 tile sizes measured and explanation about the choice.
    Note that there are 3 tiles involved, 2 input tiles and one output tile into which the result is accumulated.
    Bandwidth, Flops and point in roofline model for each tile choice.
    (25 points)

3. Measure the MKL matrix multiplication routine, calculate bandwidth and flops and add to the roofline model.
